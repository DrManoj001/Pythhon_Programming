'''Pythagorean triples are a set of 3 positive numbers that fit in the formula of the Pythagoras theorem which is expressed as, 
a2 + b2 = c2, where a, b, and c are positive integers. 
Here, 'c' is the 'hypotenuse' or the longest side of the triangle and 'a' and 'b' are the other two legs of the right-angled triangle. 
The Pythagorean triples are represented as (a,b, c). The most popular example of Pythagorean triples is (3, 4, 5). We can verify that 3, 4 and 5 
satisfy the equation a2 + b2 = c2. Let us see how! 32 + 42 = 52 â‡’ 9 + 16 = 25. 
Observe the right-angled triangle given below which shows the Pythagorean triples, 3, 4, and 5.

while c < limit:
    for n in range(1, m + 1):
        a = m * m - n * n
        b = 2 * m * n
        c = m * m + n * n
        if c > limit:
            break
        if a == 0 or b == 0 or c == 0:
            break
        print(a, b, c)
    m = m + 1
